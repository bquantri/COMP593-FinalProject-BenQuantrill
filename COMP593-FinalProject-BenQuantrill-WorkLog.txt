2022/05/01 7:10pm - get_image_path

I know the steps: remove name from last part of url, join name to directory path saved earlier

- received multiple syntax errors with INSERT INTO, fixed by checking comma and brace placement
- after troubleshooting information 
- receiving error where it will not allow me to insert date into date column without further errors,
won't support datetime as a type, will allow me to sub db_path with no errors oddly enough


2022/05/02 12:35am - image_already_in_db

2022/05/02 1:10am set_desktop_background_image

- resolution poor
